# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(k), k is size of the alphabet

# Given a string which contains only lowercase letters,
# remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear
# once and only once. You must make sure your result is
# the smallest in lexicographical order among all
# possible results.
#
# Example:
# Given "bcabc"
# Return "abc"
#
# Given "cbacdcbc"
# Return "acdb"
