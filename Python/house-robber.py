# from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected
# and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
#
# Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
# determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
