# Time:  O(n * d), n is length of string, d is size of dictionary
# Space: O(d)
#
# Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:
# 
# Only one letter can be changed at a time
# Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
# For example,
# 
# Given:
# start = "hit"
# end = "cog"
# dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
# As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
# return its length 5.
# 
# Note:
# Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
#
