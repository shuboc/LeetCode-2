# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1)

# Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters,
# find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
#
# This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
#
# Note:
# Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
# "abccccdd"
#
# Output:
# 7
#
# Explanation:
# One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
