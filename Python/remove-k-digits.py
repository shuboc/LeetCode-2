# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(n)

# Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string,
# remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
#
# Note:
# The length of num is less than 10^5 and will be >= k.
# The given num does not contain any leading zero.
# Example 1:
#
# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: num = "10200", k = 1
# Output: "200"
# Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. 
# Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: num = "10", k = 2
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
