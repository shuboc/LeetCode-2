# Time:  O(n * k), n is the number of coins, k is the amount of money
# Space: O(k)
#
# You are given coins of different denominations and
# a total amount of money amount. Write a function to
# compute the fewest number of coins that you need to
# make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot
# be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
#
# Example 1:
# coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
# return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)
#
# Example 2:
# coins = [2], amount = 3
# return -1.
#
# Note:
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
