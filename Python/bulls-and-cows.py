# You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend:
# You write a 4-digit secret number and ask your friend to guess it,
# each time your friend guesses a number, you give a hint, the hint 
# tells your friend how many digits are in the correct positions 
# (called "bulls") and how many digits are in the wrong positions 
# (called "cows"), your friend will use those hints to find out the
# secret number.
#
# For example:
#
# Secret number:  1807
# Friend's guess: 7810
# Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
# According to Wikipedia: "Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls
# or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking mind or 
# paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the similar 
# commercially marketed board game Mastermind. The numerical version of 
# the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 
# 3 or any other number of digits."
#
# Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and 
# friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows,
# in the above example, your function should return 1A3B.
#
# You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain
# digits, and their lengths are always equal.
#

# One pass solution.
