# For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size.
# So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area,
# your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L
# and width W satisfy the following requirements:
#
# 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
#
# 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
#
# 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
# You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
# Example:
# Input: 4
# Output: [2, 2]
# Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
# But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,
# [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
# Note:
# The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
# The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.
