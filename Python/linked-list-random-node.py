# Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list.
# Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.
#
# Follow up:
# What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you?
# Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?
#
# Example:
#
# // Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
# ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
# head.next = new ListNode(2);
# head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
# Solution solution = new Solution(head);
#
# // getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly.
# Each element should have equal probability of returning.
# solution.getRandom();
