# The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
# 
# Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, 
# print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
# 
# For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
# 
# 00 - 0
# 01 - 1
# 11 - 3
# 10 - 2
# Note:
# For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
# 
# For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according
# to the above definition.
# 
# For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code
# sequence. Sorry about that.
