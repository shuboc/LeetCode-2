# Time:  O(logn)
# Space: O(1)

# There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right,
# remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
#
# Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left,
# remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
#
# We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left,
# until a single number remains.
#
# Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
# n = 9,
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# 2 4 6 8
# 2 6
# 6
#
# Output:
# 6
