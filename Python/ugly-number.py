# Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
#
# Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include
# 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it
# includes another prime factor 7.
#
# Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

            return False
        for i in [2, 3, 5]:
            while num % i == 0:
                num /= i
