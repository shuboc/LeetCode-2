# Have you thought about this?
# Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
# 
# If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
# 
# Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, 
# then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
# 
# Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option? 
# You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an extra parameter).
