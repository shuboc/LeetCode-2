# Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string
# (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T
# appears no less than k times.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# s = "aaabb", k = 3
#
# Output:
# 3
#
# The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# s = "ababbc", k = 2
#
# Output:
# 5
#
# The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

# Recursive solution.
