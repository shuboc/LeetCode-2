# Given an array S of n integers, 
# find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. 
# Return the sum of the three integers. 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
#
# For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
#
# The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
