# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range
# sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
# Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements
# in nums between indices i and j (i <= j), inclusive.
#
# Note:
# A naive algorithm of O(n^2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
#
# Example:
# Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
# Return 3.
# The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and
# their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

# Divide and Conquer solution.
