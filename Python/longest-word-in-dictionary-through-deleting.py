# Given a string and a string dictionary,
# find the longest string in the dictionary
# that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string.
# If there are more than one possible results,
# return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.
# If there is no possible result, return the empty string.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
#
# Output: 
# "apple"
# Example 2:
# Input:
# s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]
#
# Output: 
# "a"
# Note:
# All the strings in the input will only contain lower-case letters.
# The size of the dictionary won't exceed 1,000.
# The length of all the strings in the input won't exceed 1,000.
