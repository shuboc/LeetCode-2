# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
# 
# Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
# The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
# For example,
# 
# Consider the following matrix:
# 
# [
#   [1,   3,  5,  7],
#   [10, 11, 16, 20],
#   [23, 30, 34, 50]
# ]
# Given target = 3, return true.
