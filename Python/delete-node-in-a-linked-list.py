# Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list,
# given only access to that node.
#
# Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node
# with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param {ListNode} node
    # @return {void} Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
