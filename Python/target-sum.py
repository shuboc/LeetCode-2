# Time:  O(n * S)
# Space: O(S)

# You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an,
# and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -.
# For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.
#
# Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
#
# -1+1+1+1+1 = 3
# +1-1+1+1+1 = 3
# +1+1-1+1+1 = 3
# +1+1+1-1+1 = 3
# +1+1+1+1-1 = 3
#
# There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
# Note:
# The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
# The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
# Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.
