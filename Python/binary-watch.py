# A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11),
# and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
#
# Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
#
# For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".
#
# Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on,
# return all possible times the watch could represent.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: n = 1
# Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
# Note:
# The order of output does not matter.
# The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
