# Time:  O(n)

#
# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from
# 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
#
# For example,
# Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.
#
# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. 
# Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
